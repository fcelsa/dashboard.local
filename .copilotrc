# .copilotrc - Project AI Guidelines

[comments]
# Code comments must be brief and in English.
# Existing comments (possibly edited by the user) must NOT be changed.
# If you add lines to existing comments, tag them with @YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., @2026-02-04).
# For complex functions, prefer multi-line comments using JSDoc syntax.

[commits]
# Commit descriptions must be short sentences in English.

[code-style]
# Where relevant and useful, prefer Lambda (arrow) functions over traditional functions.
